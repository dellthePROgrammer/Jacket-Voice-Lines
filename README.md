# Jacket-Voice-Lines
# This file was made with the intention of being used with a halloween costume of the character Jacket from Payday 2 which allows the person to play voice lines of the character by pressing a button on their hand to play the corresponding voice lines
# the idea of the random module to randomize the files as well as putting the voice_lines into a list was made by https://github.com/Kostowniak
# The initial creator of this code is https://github.com/dellthePROgrammer
# The code was developed on windows then brought to a raspberry pi where 3 buttons are used to play a different voice line
