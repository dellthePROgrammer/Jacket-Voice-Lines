Jacket-Voice-Lines
This file was made with the intention of being used with a halloween costume of the character Jacket from Payday 2 which allows the person to play voice lines of the character by pressing a button on their hand to play the corresponding voice lines
the idea of the random module to randomize the files as well as putting the voice_lines into a list was made by https://github.com/Kostowniak
The initial creator of this code is https://github.com/dellthePROgrammer
The code was developed on windows then brought to a raspberry pi where 3 buttons are used to play a different set of voice lines voice line
The button correspond to the differnet voice line type one button is used for the many "greeting" voice lines while arms is for a specific voice line and upon holding the arms button long enough you play 2 other voice lines that correspond with what comes after arms_outstretched and the random button coresponds with the other random voice lines that the character uses
